The economic condition of traders, customers, and financial institutions has been significantly 
influenced by the finance sector. With the use of cutting-edge deep learning and machine 
learning algorithms, artificial intelligence such as deep learning are having significant impacts in finance. Deep 
learning and machine learning models are used by traders and investors to predict the movements 
of financial instruments. Investment methods in the stock market are intricate and depend on a 
thorough analysis of a large quantity of data. The Yahoo-finance dataset \citep{dataset} displays many firm 
aspects for stocks, news, quotations, and other items for every potential shift across time. 
Using transformers and ARIMA-ANN, we build a model that predicts prices at each instant of time.
