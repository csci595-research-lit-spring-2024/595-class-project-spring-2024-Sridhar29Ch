The economic condition of traders, customers, and financial institutions has been significantly 
influenced by the finance sector. With the use of cutting-edge deep learning and machine 
learning algorithms, artificial intelligence such as deep learning are having significant impacts in finance. These methods are widely used in financial instrument pricing prediction, portfolio 
optimization, market trend research, and opportunity identification for investments. Deep 
learning and machine learning models are used by traders and investors to predict the movements 
of financial instruments. Investment methods in the stock market are intricate and depend on a 
thorough analysis of a large quantity of data. The Yahoo-finance dataset \cite{dataset} displays many firm 
aspects for stocks, news, quotations, and other items for every potential shift across time. 
Using transformers and ARIMA-ANN, we build a model that predicts prices at each instant of time. We have 
taken into consideration three instances of time: one day, one hour, and five minutes, for the 
dataset to be compared on monthly and yearly models. 
Depending on the kind of algorithms selected, we label the maximum ticker counts as M, for 
which M-1 tickers are trained to forecast the final ticker. In order to anticipate stocks or 
prices for the last tickers, this study will employ Transformer Neural Networks and Arima-ANN 
hybrids, indicating the DL model. We will then compare the accuracy of these machine learning 
techniques.
