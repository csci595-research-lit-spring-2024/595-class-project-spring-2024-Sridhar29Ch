We are able to train Yahoo finance data with the transformer neural networks and ARIMA-ANN Hybrid. We used the co-variance relations between the tickers to do the predictions. And In designing the ARIMA-ANN hybrid we first trained the ARIMA and we calculate the residual. Then we used that residual to train the ANN. Then with this trained  ANN we did the predictions of the stock price. For Transformer neural network we recored less RMSE error when compared to the ARIMA-ANN hybrid.
