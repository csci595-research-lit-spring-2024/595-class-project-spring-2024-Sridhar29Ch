\section{Conclusions}
Based on the average error findings in each of the selected stock prediction firms, we have effectively demonstrated in this study that our suggested TNN model is significantly better than the ARIMA-ANN hybrid. The suggested design performs better than the original plan overall and shows the optimal outcomes for a 1-hour and 5-minute time frame. To improvise such adjustments, it will be necessary to evaluate additional elements of the relative likelihood of the stock prices and yet substantial improvements on the bi-cubic interpolation technique.


\section{Future work}
TWhen compared to the ARIMA-ANN Hybrid, the TNN architecture often offers superior average error margins. With a bi-cubic and multinominal dimensionality technique, the effective change in the time series prediction will be more effective since only dense layers were selected. In all scenarios with varying stock values, the overall design layer improvement with custom optimization layers may be applied to the design lowering the total loss less than 1%.
